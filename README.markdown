Move the most recent file in pre-defined folder to the current folder

I made this program so I could move my just-downloaded file
into my current working directory.

Usage:

    mvdl [ARGUMENT]

Arguments:

    help, -?, --help        - Display the help text
    undo, -u, --undo        - Undo last action performed by mvdl
    history, -h, --history  - Display the mvdl history

External programs req'd:

 - bash (probably won't work with other shells)
