TO DO:

  - handle if file already exists at target? (maybe a "mv --interactive" call or something?)

  - maybe make it so you have to type a destination, so that executing it without args cause a usage message? (SAFER!) (don't forget that if you do this, you'll need to change the arg handling to deal with just a "-w" arg or something for the "what file?" option.)
